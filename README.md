FakeFriends is a project that was originally created at Le Wagon Berlin for batch 1141.
The Demo Day version can be viewed here: https://fakefriends.herokuapp.com/. It was programmed by Felix Cramer, Florian Miller, and myself.
After the bootcamp, the project was discontinued. However, I have decided to take over and include many features that we wanted to add but were unable to due to time limitations. This is my version of how the project should be.
