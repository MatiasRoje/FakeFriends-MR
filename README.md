FakeFriends is a project that was originally created at Le Wagon Berlin for batch 1141.
The Demo Day version from the Bootcamp can be viewed here: https://fakefriends.herokuapp.com/
It was programmed by Felix Cramer, Florian Miller, and myself.
After the bootcamp, the project was discontinued. However, I have decided to take over and include many features that we wanted to add but were unable to due to time limitations. This is my version of how the project should be.

It is programmed in Ruby on Rails, with the frontend using HTML, SASS, and animations from Animate.css, powered by multiple Stimulus controllers. User authentication is ensured by Devise. Cloudinary is used for photo storage, and PostgreSQL for data management. Users can interact dynamically through chatrooms programmed with Redis and Action Cable.
